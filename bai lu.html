        <h1><b> My Favorite Chinese Actress </b></h1>
        <p> Bai Lu become my favorite actress because of her series 'The legend', I really love how she portray her role in that drama, since I 
            got hook to her, I started watching her other series or dramas, and just like 'The legend' she slay those roles as will. 
            And because of these, I consider her as a great and versatile actress. </p>
