        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bai Lu become my favorite actress because of her series <i>'The legend'</i>, I really love how she portrays her role in that drama, ever since I 
            got hook to her, I started watching her other series or dramas, and just like <i>'The legend'</i> she slay those roles as will. 
            And because of these, I consider her as a great and versatile actress. </p>
